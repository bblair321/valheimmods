How to install mods
After you have downloaded the files from the releases section you will get a zip folder.
The first time you download them you will have to unzip the file manually. After that I have a script that I made that will do it for you.
To unzip right click on the folder and click extract.
This should create a new folder that isn't zipped. Open that folder up and you should see a file called installscript_v1.
Right click on this and click run with powershell. A windows will pop up asking you if your sure you want to run the script click on yes.
After that you may get a prompt in a blue box asking you if you want to run the script once or abort. Press R on your keyboard and the script should then run. 
At one point the script will ask you for the location of your Valheim game. You can find this by right clicking on the game in steam and going to manage --> and go to browse files.
Copy the file path or type it into the box and click ok.
